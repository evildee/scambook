				<h3>How business resolve works</h3>
				<p>Business Resolve is a unique system introducing a neutral platform, enabling
				businesses to resolve complaints with their customers quickly and discreetly.
				</p>
				<p>
You will be notified of any activity in your Dashboard via email. You will also be
able to monitor all complaints and the pending ones in your Dashboard at anytime.
				</p>
				<p>
There are 3 ways to get a complaint removed from the Scambook site.
				</p>
				<p>
				You can:
					</p><ul class="bullets">
						<li>
						Offer a full or partial refund directly from our system.
						</li>
						<li>
						Send a resolution offer to the consumer if the complaint has been resolved outside of Scambook.
						</li>
						<li>
						If applicable, ask for the Scambook to assist in getting the complaint resolved. <br>
						<a href="/business/user_guide/10">Click here to learn more...</a>						</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>
				After an attempt has been made:
				</h4>
				<p>
				After making an offer, there is a 7-day hold period on the offer.
				</p>
				<p>
				If the consumer "accepts" your offer, the complaint is removed from Scambook
through our automated system.
				</p>
				<p>
				If the consumer "declines" your offer, it is to your discretion to make another offer
with a different amount, or to use a different action attempt.
				</p>
				<p>
				If your attempts are not getting a response, you have the option of getting Scambook
involved. We will attempt to contact the consumer on your behalf and review the
complaint filed against your company. If we do not hear from the consumer, we
will rule in your favor and remove the complaint. This process may take 2-3 weeks
depending on the frequency of communication from the consumer.

					How to set-up your company profile
				</h3>
				<p>Completing your company profile is important for many reasons:
				</p>
				<p>
					</p><ul class="bullets">
						<li>It shows consumers that you are a credible business and want to actively
improve your customer satisfaction ratings.
						</li>
						<li>It gives consumers a way to contact you. At times, you may want to try and
settle the complaint outside of Scambook before making an offer. Having
your contact phone number can give the consumer a way to reach you.
						</li>
						<li>Consumers can actively see your resolution actions with each consumer on
your group page.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Depositing funds</h3>
					<p>In order to start making offers in your Dashboard, you must deposit funds into your
					account.
					</p>
					<div class="screenshot-wrapper">
						<img src="/media/css/css-img/guide-screenshot-depositfunds.png" width="590px">
					</div><!-- screenshot-wrapper -->				
					<p>There is a one time $2.99 surcharge fee for every attempt made. This amount must
	also be available in your account before making any offers.
					</p>
					<p>After making a refund offer (if applicable) to a consumer, the funds will be placed
	on "hold" during the 7-day offer period. If your offer to the consumer is not
	accepted or ignored after the 7-days, your funds will be deposited back into your
	account.</p>
			</div> <!-- box-container-round -->
			
			<div class="box-container-round">
				<h3>Complaint prevention</h3>
					<p>Complaint prevention is available for Enterprise account users only.
					</p>
					<p>Scambook gives a business up to 72 hours to find a mutual resolution before the
	complaint goes live on the Scambook website. If the complaint is mutually resolved
	within that 72 hour window, the complaint will be removed.
					</p>
					<p>New complaints are under your "Unresolved Complaints" tab in your Dashbard, they
	will be "on hold".
					</p>
					<div class="screenshot-wrapper">
						<img src="/media/css/css-img/guide-screenshot-complaintprevention.png" width="590px">
						<p>
						You will have 72 hours to resolve before the complaint goes live.
						</p>
					</div><!-- screenshot-wrapper -->				
					<p>If the complaint is not resolved within the 72 hour timeframe, the complaint will be
	visible to the public, and the consumer will still have what is left of the 7 day offer
	period to accept or decline your offer to resolve.
					</p>
			</div> <!-- box-container-round -->
			
			<div class="box-container-round">
				<h3>Offer a refund</h3>
				<p>
					This action gives the consumer a direct refund through your Dashboard.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You make the choice to offer whatever amount you feel is best. In most cases, a 100% refund draws a faster response from the consumer, which in turn gives a faster complaint removal rate. We also offer check options in some cases.
				</p>
				
				<p>If you want to change your amount of refund after you have sent your offer, you have the ability to offer more. Simply click on the pending offer and enter your new dollar amount you want to offer.
				</p>
				
				<p>Once the consumer decides to "accept" your offer, the funds from your account will be transferred to the consumers Paypal. We also offer check options in some refund cases. "Accepting" your offer removes the complaint from the Scambook site through our automated system.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In the case where the consumer does not respond or your offer is declined, the funds will be put back into your account. 
				</p>
			</div> <!-- box-container-round -->
			
			<div class="box-container-round">
				<h3>Already resolved outside of Scambook</h3>
				<p>In come cases, you may have resolved the complaint outside of our Scambook
				Dashboard. This option allows you to send a notification to the consumer that you
				want to resolve the complaint through Scambook.
				</p>
				<p>This option can also be used after you get more information about the complaint
from the consumer through our messaging system.
				</p>
				<div class="screenshot-wrapper">

				<p>Once the consumer "accepts" your offer, the complaint is removed from our
Scambook site through our automated system.
				</p>
				<p>If your complaint is declined, the complaint remains on the Scambook site and it is
up to your discretion to make another offer.
				</p>
				<p>After an attempt that's ignored, you will be given the option to have Scambook assist
in the resolution process. <br>

				<p>Once the consumer responds to the message, it is then up to you to decide which
of the two options you want to use to resolve with the consumer. You can offer a
refund, or decide that the complaint has been resolved outside of Scambook.
				</p>

				<p>Scambook will not remove any complaints if the consumer is declining your offers.

filed against your company.
