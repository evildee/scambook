                         I am so happy I found Scambook. I placed a complaint recently; I can’t believe how much you guys are doing to help me!!! I had placed a complaint already with the BBB online, and they didn’t do nearly as much! What a terrific service. Thanks for sticking up for the “little people”!

                    While reviewing our online account info, discovered an unauthorized amount pending. A quick Google search led me here to ScamBook.com to find we weren't the only one to be in this position. Thank you, ScamBook and thank you to our financial institution who remedied the incident immediately.

                    Thanks to this website, I was able to cancel my PayPal payment before it went through....Whew, I ALMOST got ripped off! I found it odd I didn't get a conformation e-mail so I goggled the company and found all these complaints. I think pay pal better wise up and check out their vendors before serving them and taking our money!Thank you scambook for calling out these rip offs!
